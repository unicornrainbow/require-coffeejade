# Demo

The demo is designed to easily let you see example code in action. A small Sinatra
web server is included so that you can easily host the files for viewing. You
will need an appropriate ruby environment to use the server. If this doesn't
work for you, feel free to host the files in what ever way is most convenient.

# Running the demo server

    cd demo
    bundle install
    ruby server.rb
